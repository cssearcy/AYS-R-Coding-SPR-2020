# I.  Course Description

Data is an essential ingredient of any program evaluation or performance management system. Organizations that want to embrace an evidence-based approach to policy need to develop processes for gathering data, linking multiple datasets, running analysis, and sharing results with stakeholders through reports, dashboards, or web applications. The ability to collect, organize and analyze data is a desirable skill set for professional analysts, high-level management, and evaluators.

The course introduces students to the R data programming language, an open source platform that has become an industry standard because of its flexibility and power. It was designed to allow people to quickly develop and share new statistical tools. It has evolved into a more general data analytics platform that can be used for analytics, customized visualizations, GIS applications, text analysis, building web applications, and much more. It has a large and active user community that has developed thousands of free custom programs.

Typically only 10-20% of a project is spent analyzing data. The other 80-90% consists of merging data sources, cleaning data, defining new variables, and arranging data into the proper format. These steps require knowledge about data wrangling as well as general project management process. 

This course, Coding in R for Policy Analytics, will cover the building blocks of data programming in R. We will learn about variables, operators, functions, dataset construction, group structure in data, and visualization. Students will also be introduced to markdown documents and automated reporting.

## A. Learning Objectives

The six learning objectives for the course are:

- Mastery of functions as the building blocks of all R programs, including arguments and scope
- Knowledge of variable types and data structures in R, including construction and manipulation of data sets
- Use of logical statements to create and analyze groups within data
- Ability to build custom visualizations through the base R graphics package
- Creation of dynamic graphics and data dashboards using R shiny tools

## B. Course Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites, and we do not assume any prior background in computer programming or statistics. Students should, however, have installed R and R Studio, and worked through a basic tutorial on R Studio.

# II. Assessment of Student Learning

Assessment of student performance in this course is based on indications that the course learning objectives stated above have been achieved.  Several areas of measurement will be used to produce a final grade.  These areas include:

- The ability to build a custom dataset from multiple sources, merging, reshaping, filtering, or subsetting as necessary.
- Translating from plain English business cases to logical statements in R using logical operators and analytical techniques applied to groups.
- Communicating information by developing custom visualizations and graphics.
- Using markdown documents to generate data-driven reports and data dashboards.

Students will demonstrate competency in understanding, producing, and communicating results of their analyses through the following assignments:

- Weekly labs that provide opportunities to consolidate and apply material from course content.
- Discussion topics on broad data science trends. 
- A final project that integrates several skills to create a data dashboard. 

Assigned work, including the course final project, and the quality of active participation in online discussion sessions that are a critical part of the course learning strategy are the tools the instructors will use to measure comprehension and skill; the student&#39;s course grade is a direct reflection of demonstrated performance. Students should take stated expectations seriously regarding preparation, conduct, and academic honesty in order to receive a grade reflective of outstanding performance.  Students should be aware that merely completing assigned work in no way guarantees an outstanding grade in the course. To receive an outstanding course grade (using the grading scheme described below and the performance assessment approach noted above) all assigned work should completed on time with careful attention to assignment details.

# III. Course Structure

## A. Format

Mastering advanced analytical techniques and data programming is like learning a language. You start by mastering basic vocabulary that is specific to statistics and data science. Progress might be slow at first as you work to master core concepts, integrate the building blocks into a coherent mental model of real-world problems, learn to translate technical results into clear narratives for non-technical audiences, and become comfortable with data programming skills. 

Similar to immersion in a language, the best way to learn the material is to be consistent in doing course work each day. The more frequently you revisit concepts and practice data programming the more you will absorb. The curriculum has been designed around this approach. Modules are split into small units, and each unit includes questions to test your understanding of the material. Weekly labs allow you to spend some time applying the material to a specific problem. The final project at the end of the semester is designed to help you make connections between concepts and consolidate knowledge. You will be much better off spending a small amount of time each day on the material instead of trying to cram everything into a couple of days a week.

Online discussion boards are design for students to engage with the material together. The purpose of online discussion sessions is threefold: (1) the online discussion sessions allow students to interact with their peers and share ideas and interpretations of the assigned material, (2) such peer-to-peer discussion online helps build professional relationships with potential future colleagues in the field, and (3) the discussions permit the instructor to assess student engagement with the assigned material.

## B. Assigned Reading Materials

We will use a custom textbook for this course. 

* [Course Textbook](https://ds4ps.org/dp4ss/)

The following texts are recommended as good reference material for topics covered in this course:

* Wickham, H., &amp; Grolemund, G. (2016). _R for Data Science._ O&#39;Reilly Press. _(free online)_  
* Teetor, P. (2011). _R Cookbook: Proven recipes for data analysis, statistics, and graphics_. &quot; O&#39;Reilly Media, Inc.&quot;.  
* Sanchez, G. (2013). _Handling and processing strings in R._ Berkeley: Trowchez Editions. _(free online)_  
* Peng, R. D., &amp; Matsui, E. (2015). _The Art of Data Science._ _A Guide for Anyone Who Works with Data._ Skybrude Consulting, 200, 162.  


In addition to the required textbooks, the instructor may supplement the assigned unit readings with various journal articles, policy reports, or other related material. These will be made available in iCollege. Please be sure to set notifications in iCollege so that you receive emails when announcements are posted. 

## C. Course Grading

Letter grades comport with a traditional set of intervals:

------------|--------
100 – 99%   |  A+  
98 – 94%    |  A  
93 – 90%    |  A - 
89 – 87%    |  B+  
86 – 84%    |  B  
83 – 80%    |  B –  
Below 80%   |  C, D, F  

The assigned work for the course has three elements:

- **Weekly Labs (50%):**  Each week you will receive a short lab that will help you synthesize the modules from the week though exercises that involve data, analysis, and important formulas from the modules. These labs contain exercises that are similar in form or difficulty to what will be applied in the final project. **They are graded pass / fail** by the instructors based upon an assessment of whether you have sincerely attempted the lab and answered over half of the questions correctly. This is designed to hold you accountable for the material, but not create anxiety about perfection.

- **Final Dashboard Project (30%):**  This course will end with a final project that requires you to analyze some data and present your results as a data dashboard. It is designed to give you practice integrating the material that we have covered throughout the course. The instructions for the project will be accompanied by a rubric describing the allocation of points and criteria for evaluation.

- **Code-Through Project (10%):**  In addition to the final dashboard project, you will be asked to complete a "Code Through", or tutorial of sorts, in R Markdown. This tutorial is an introduction to a new concept, technique, function, package, or dataset in R that has not been covered in this course.  See the Course Schedule for more details.

- **Discussion Topics (10%):**  iCollege discussion topics are used to introduce you to the data science ecosystem. Since this course focuses on the skill of learning data programming we cannot cover exciting resources and developments in the broad field of data science. The weekly discussion topics are a chance to explore some resources or reflect on a specific theme or article on your own. We will use iCollege discussion boards for this assignment. You need to earn at least 100 points by posting topics and interacting with peers in order to earn full credit. The points each week are allocated as follows:

  - 5 points for a new post with at least 200 words
  - 3 points for a substantive comment (> 50 words) made to another student's post
  - 2 points if you receive a comment on your post
  - 3 points if you earn instructor praise for an informative post
  - Max of 20 points can be earned each week

## D. Late and Missing Assignments

Grades for the course are largely based on weekly labs. Assigned work is accompanied by detailed instructions, adequate time for completion, and opportunities to consult the instructor with questions. As a result, each assignment element in the course is expected to be completed by the due date. Once solutions for labs are posted, it is no longer possible to receive points for assignments. Final projects will not be accepted 24 hours past the due date. **Late submissions will be reduced by one point per day late, rounding up.**

## E.  Course Communication and Getting Help

All course content is hosted on this website. Readings, assignments, and other course materials will be distributed via this site and/or through announcements on iCollege. **All assignment submissions will be made through iCollege and are due by 11:59pm on the due dates listed on the course schedule.** 

**You should make every attempt to attend weekly lab sessions to get help on lab work.** If you miss a lab session, please post questions on the [Get Help](https://cssearcy.github.io/AYS-R-Coding-SPR-2020/help/) page on this site. You may also schedule individual office hours using the instructor links provided above, or you may email the instructor directly. 

Students should be aware that the course instructor will attempt to respond to any course-related email as quickly as possible. Students are asked to allow between 24 and 48 hours for replies to direct instructor emails, generally, as a reasonable time to reply to questions or other issues posed in an email. Additionally, the general timeline for instructor grading or other feedback on assignments, either written work or online discussion work, is between 5 and 10 work days.

## F.  Student Conduct

Respectful conversations and tolerance of others&#39; opinions will be strictly enforced. Any inappropriate language, threatening, harassing, or otherwise inappropriate behavior during discussion could result in the student(s) being administratively dropped from the course with no refund. Students are required to adhere to the behavior standards listed in the GSU Sudent Code of Conduct.

## G.  Academic Integrity and Honesty

GSU expects the highest standards of academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity include but are not limited to cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, etc. or facilitating any of these activities. This course relies heavily on writing and original critical thought. Any student who is suspected of not producing his or her own original work will be reported to the Dean of Students for investigation. **Plagiarism will not be tolerated**. **Any student who plagiarizes or otherwise fabricates his or her work will receive no credit for that assignment. It will be recorded as zero points—and the student will risk a failing grade for the course.** For more information, refer to the GSU Student Code of Conduct.

## H.  Student Accommodations

**Disability Accommodations:** If you have any condition, such as a physical or mental disability, which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work as outlined above or which will require extra time on assignments, please notify us in the first two weeks of the course so that we may make appropriate arrangements. Students who wish to request accommodation for a disability may do so by registering with the GSU Access & Accommodations Center (AACE). Students may only be accommodated upon issuance of a signed Accommodation Plan by AAACE. Students are responsible for providing a copy of that plan to instructors of all classes in which an accommodation is sought.

**Religious accommodations:** Students will not be penalized for missing an assignment due solely to a religious holiday/observance, but as this class operates with a fairly flexible schedule, all efforts should be made to complete work within the required timeframe. If this is not possible, students must notify the instructor as far in advance as possible in order to make an alternative arrangement.

**Military Accommodations:** A student who is a member of the National Guard, Reserve, or other branch of the armed forces and is unable to complete classes because of military activation may request complete or partial unrestricted administrative withdrawals or incompletes depending on the timing of the activation. Please notify the instructor as soon as you are aware of a potential activation.

# IV. Course Schedule

This course spans a rigorous seven week schedule. A schedule for each week of the term is outlined here; the course is divided into seven units with learning objectives for each unit.

Please note: the course instructor may from time to time adjust assigned readings or adjust the due dates for assignment. The basic course content approach and learning objectives will not change, but slight modifications are possible if circumstances warrant an adjustment.
