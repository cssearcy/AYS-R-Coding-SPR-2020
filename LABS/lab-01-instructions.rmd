## Functions

You will use the following functions for this lab: 

```{r,eval=F}
names()                 # variable names
head()                  # preview dataset
length()                # vector length (number of elements)
dim(), nrow(), ncol()   # dataset dimensions
sum(), summary()        # summarize numeric vectors
table()                 # summarize factors / character vectors
```

<br><br>



# Data

This lab uses **city tax parcel data** from Syracuse, NY. [ [Data Dictionary](https://ds4ps.github.io/Data-Science-Class/DATA/syr_parcels.html) ]

* Each house, business, park or empty lot in the city sits on a parcel of land, and the tax rate for that parcel is determined by the city. 
* All of the characteristics of each parcel is stored in a central database, along with information about the land use classifications, owners, and whether the property is up-to-date on taxes and water bills.  
* Each row represents one tax parcel, and all tax parcels in the city are recorded in the dataset.  

```{r, echo=F}
URL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS4PS/Data-Science-Class/master/DATA/syr_parcels.csv"
dat <- read.csv( URL, stringsAsFactors=FALSE )
head( dat, 10 ) # show first ten rows of data
```

<br>
<br>


## Loading Data Into R

You can load the dataset by including the following code chunk in your file: 

```{r, eval=F}
URL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS4PS/Data-Science-Class/master/DATA/syr_parcels.csv"
dat <- read.csv( URL, stringsAsFactors=FALSE )
```

Note that referencing variables in R requires both the **dataset name** and **variable name**, separated by the `$` operator:

```{r, eval=F}
summary( dat$acres )
```

Unlike other stats programs, you can have several datasets loaded at the same time in R. They will often have variables with the same name (if you create a subset, for example, and save it as a new object you will have two datasets with identical names). To avoid conflicts R forces you to use the `dataset$variable` convention.

# Lab Instructions

Answer the following questions using the Syracuse parcels dataset and the functions listed. 

Your solution should include a written response to the question, as well as the code used to generate the result.


--- 



#### 1. How many tax parcels are in Syracuse? 

> dataset dimensions: **dim()** or **nrow()** 
<br>
    
#### 2. How many acres of land are in syracuse?

> **sum()** over the numeric **acres** vector
<br>


#### 3. How many vacant BUILDINGS are there in Syracuse?

> **sum()** over the **vacantbuil** logical vector
<br>

    
#### 4. What proportion of parcels are tax exempt?

> **sum()** plus **length()** functions withthe logical **tax.exempt** vector
<br>


    
#### 5. Which neighborhood contains the most tax parcels?

> **table()** with the **neighborhood** variable
<br>

    
#### 6. Which neighborhood contains the most vacant LOTS?

> **table()** with the **neighborhood** and **land_use** variables

**HELPFUL HINTS:**


When you apply a **sum()** function to a numeric vector it returns the sum of all elements in the vector. 

```{r, eval=F}
sum( c(10,20,5) )  # 35
```

When you apply a **sum()** function to a logical vector, it will count all of the TRUEs:

```{r, eval=F}
x <- c( TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE )
sum( x )                # number of TRUEs
sum( x ) / length( x )  # proportion of TRUEs
```


R wants to make sure you are aware of missing values, so it will return NA (not available) for functions performed on vectors with missing values. 

Add the 'NA remove' argument (`na.rm=TRUE`) to functions to ignore missing values: 

```{r, eval=F}
sum( dat$star, na.rm=T )
```

# How to Submit

Use the following instructions to submit your assignment, which may vary depending on your course's platform.

<br>

### Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Perform the following depending on your course's platform:

* **Canvas:** Upload both your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files to the appropriate link
* **Blackboard or iCollege:** Compress your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files in a `.ZIP` file and upload to the appropriate link

`.HTML` files are preferred but not allowed by all platforms.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Lab-##-LastName.rmd** and **Lab-##-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 
3. Do not show excessive output; truncate your output, e.g. with function `head()`
4. Follow appropriate styling conventions, e.g. spaces after commas, etc.
5. Above all, ensure that your conventions are consistent

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>
<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
