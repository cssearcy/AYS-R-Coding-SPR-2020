# Overview

Lab 04 builds on the static graphic created in Lab 03 by rendering key 
graphical elements, such as the trendline and legend, as interactive and 
responsive to user inputs, just like any other app. Visit the final app

# Dynamic Graphics

Recall that Shiny allows you to build interactive data products. An app's 
interactivity occurs between user input and machine output.

* User Interface (`ui.r`): Where end users exercise control and view server outputs
* Server (`server.r`): Where function operations occur based on user inputs

Note that in the server code, any dynamic code must be within a 
"reactive context", which typically lies within curly brackets, or `{ ... }`.

<br>
<br>

# Assignment Requirements

In addition to modifying your dashboard with your name, Lab 04 requires the 
following: 

1. Add the Lab 03 visualization code in the server/chunk
2. Add an additional trendline to your graphic representing a user-selected region
3. Add a `selectInput()` control function to the app UI and connect it to the server

<br>

In addition, you must install and load the following packages in your script. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(flexdashboard)
library(shinydashboard)

```

<br>

### Adding the Lab 03 Code

Regardless of what visualization or Shiny packages you use, you must place your 
Lab 03 visualization code within a `renderPlot()` function.

<br>

### Adding a Trend Line

Depending on which visualization package you choose, you will need to append a 
new trend line differently.

* For `ggplot2`, consider using `geom_line()` or `geom_path()`
* For `graphics`, consider using `points()` or `lines()`

Note that the trend line will contain the "reactive" shiny input. You only need 
to experiment with this part of the visualization code to be successful.

<br>

### Adding & Connecting Input Controls

Regardless of your visualization or dashboard packages used, you must use 
base Shiny function `selectInput()` and list all possible regions as well as 
a default selection.

Recall that the `inputId =` argument accepts a character string that becomes 
a unique identifier. When this ID is used in conjunction with `input$`, i.e. 
`input$id`, it acts as an object *representing* whatever value is chosen in
`selectInput()`. 

For example, if you choose "Europe East" in the UI with 
`selectInput(inputId = "my_example")`, then the server's `input$my_example` now
represents and acts as the value "Europe East".

<br>
<br>

# Shiny Package Differences

Templates are provided to complete your dashboard using any of the following 
packages:

* `shiny` in "Lab-04-LastName-shiny-v3.R"
* `flexdashboard` in "Lab-04-LastName-flex-v3.R"
* `shinydashboard` in "Lab-04-LastName-sdbp-v3.R"

Note that you need only use one, though all options will require `shiny`. 

<br>

### Package 'shiny'

Function `selectInput()` should be placed within `sidebarPanel()`. 

<br>

### Package 'flexdashboard'

The location of `selectInput()` is provided. 

<br>

### Package 'shinydashboardplus'

Function `selectInput()` should be placed within `sidebarMenu()`.

# How to Submit

You need only submit your `.Rmd` file for this week.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Lab-##-LastName.rmd**
2. Follow appropriate styling conventions, e.g. spaces after commas, etc.
3. Above all, ensure that your conventions are consistent

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for 
examples of common conventions.
